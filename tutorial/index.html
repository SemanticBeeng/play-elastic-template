			<h2>Before You Start</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Warning: </b>the Play-Elasticsearch interoperability is provided by module
				<code>com.evojam.play.elastic4s</code> which is experimental. Support is limited.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hello, you have just created a small Play Framework application
				with Elasticsearch integration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before it gets functional, you need an Elasticsearch instance up and running.
				Note that this template assumes ES version 2.2.X and <b> will not work with others.</b>
				Consult <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/setup.html" target="_blank">
					Elasticsearch setup documentation</a> for information on running a local instance
				or use a 2.2 <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/" target="_blank">docker image</a>.
				We would also suggest installing
					<a href="https://github.com/lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf" target="_blank">kopf plugin</a> as it
				gives a nice and human-friendly way of inspecting your ES cluster.
			</p>
			<p>
			Verify if your ES installation is correct by running <code>curl $ES_HOST:9200</code>
			(replace <code>$ES_HOST</code> with the proper host, e.g. <code>curl localhost:9200</code>
			if you're running a local ES instance).
			You should get output similar to the following:
			</p>
<pre>
{
  "name" : "Mosha",
  "cluster_name" : "your-fancy-cluster-name",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "2.2.0",
    "build_hash" : "8ff36d139e16f8720f2947ef62c8167a888992fe",
    "build_timestamp" : "2016-01-27T13:32:39Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "5.4.1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
</pre>
<p>
				If <code>version.number</code> is 2.2.X, you're good to go. If you get no response,
				there is a problem with your ES setup and you need to troubleshoot it before going further.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have no previous experience with ElasticSearch, it's high time you did something about it.
				Definitely install the
				<a href="https://github.com/lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf" target="_blank">kopf plugin</a>
					(if you're running the ES on your local machine,
					<code>./elasticsearch/bin/plugin install lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf/2.0</code> will do just fine),
				visit <a href="http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf" target="_blank">the kopf dashboard</a>
				and spend some time learning the basic concepts behind Elasticsearch.
				Further tutorial assumes you have the basic understanding of ES indices, documents and indexing.
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Setting up</h2>
			<p>
				All app configuration is managed via your <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>.
				As a minimum, you need to set one cluster in <code>clusters</code> node, providing <code>uri</code> and <code>cluster.name</code>.
				After setting it up you're ready to run the application using the <a href="#run/system" class="shortcut">run tab</a> or the buttons
				under the template name. Then go visit <a href="http://localhost:9000/es/stats" target="_blank">localhost:9000/es/stats</a> to check if the
				ES connection is working. You should see output similar to <code>curl $ES_HOST:9200</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Okay, you've got ES running and your app can talk to it. Now it's time to create ES indices.
				Your application <b>should not</b> be responsible for administrating the ES cluster.
				As an exception, though, we added an action for creating example index in the app.
				Simply make a POST request at <code>localhost:9200/es/index</code> to have the index created:
				<code>curl -X POST localhost:9200/es/index</code>. Now inspect your indices, either by visiting
				<a href="http://localhost:9200/_plugin/kopf" target="_blank">kopf dashboard</a> or by running
				<code>curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices</code>. You should see a new empty index called "library".
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything that happend during this step is controller by
				<a href="#code/app/controllers/ElasticController.scala" class="shortcut">ElasticController.scala</a>.
				It uses <a href="https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s" target="_blank">elastic4s DSL</a> to specify ES queries
				and <a href="https://github.com/evojam/play-elastic4s" target="_blank">play-elastic4s</a> to handle configuration and injection.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>The Model</h2>
			<p>
				It's a common practice to describe domain objects using simple case classes.
				Take a look at <a href="#code/app/model/Book.scala" class="shortcut">Book.scala</a> for an example.
				It defines a few fields and an implicit JSON formatter on a companion object. Note that
				this file has nothing to do with Elasticsearch yet, and the only connection to Play 
				is the Play JSON formatter.
			</p>
			<p>
				The JSON formatter doesn't have to be defined on the companion object.
				We find it useful, because this way it's always in implicit scope when required,
				but feel free to define it elsewhere, e.g. in a BookJsonSupport trait that you
				would mix in whenever necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having such case class is enough to build a REST API with Play.
				Inspect the action <code>getHardcoded</code> in 
				<a href="#code/app/controllers/BookController.scala" class="shortcut">BookController.scala</a>.
				It simply creates a Book instance, converts it to JSON using Play JSON helper and returns a <code>200 OK</code> response.
				Check the results by running a curl at <a href="http://localhost:9000/books/hardcoded" target="_blank">localhost:9000/books/hardcoded</a>.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Integrating with Elasticsearch</h2>
			<p>
				The application reads and writes books to Elasticsearch using a separate class,
				<a href="#code/app/model/BookDao.scala" class="shortcut">BookDao</a>. Its constructor has
				three parameters, all of which get injected
				(if you are new to constructor dependency injection,
				it's a good time to read on
				<a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaDependencyInjection" target="_blank">dependency injection in Play</a>).
				This is quite standard signature when
				using play-elastic4s module: the <code>ClusterSetup</code> represents the cluster configuration
				specified in <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>; the
				PlayElasticFactory is used to obtain ES clients, and the IndexAndType provides configuration
				of ES index and type.
			</p>
			<p>
				The specific methods are implemented using <code>ElasticDsl</code> mixin from
				<a href="https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s" target="_blank">elastic4s DSL</a>.
				Next, the <code>PlayElasticJsonSupport</code> mixin provides
				elastic4s <code>Indexable</code> and <code>HitAs</code> instances to provide
				automatic JSON conversions based on already defined Play JSON formatter.
				This way we can use the formatter defined in 
				<a href="#code/app/model/Book.scala" class="shortcut">Book.scala</a>
				to talk to Elasticsearch. Refer to
				<a href="https://github.com/evojam/play-elastic4s" target="_blank">play-elastic4s module page</a> for more information
				on that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Check the methods in 
				<a href="#code/app/controllers/BookController.scala" class="shortcut">BookController.scala</a>
				to see the full life of a request in the app (the appropriate URLs for the endpoints are defined
				in <a href="#code/conf/routes">routes</a> file).
				Note how the <code>BookDao</code> transparently handles
				Elasticsearch connection: all the public methods expose only domain objects. The controller
				is unaware of what kind of search engine is actually backing your app - and that's a Good Thing.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Next</h2>
			<p>
				Congratulations, you now know the basics of play-elastic4s integration.
				As a small hands-on excercise, you could try and split the 
				<a href="#code/app/model/BookDao.scala" class="shortcut">BookDao</a> into
				two files to separate the interface from its implementation, and then bind the implementation
				using the beforementioned 
				<a href="https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaDependencyInjection" target="_blank">dependency injection in Play</a>.
				As the next step we would highly recommend thinking your architecture over
				and preparing a data model, alongside with appropriate mappings.
				<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html" target="_blank">Elasticsearch Guide</a>
				will be unvaluable in providing information on data modelling in ES, administrating
				the ES cluster and running queries. Then you're ready to dive deeper into the implementation.
				Definitely check out the 
				<a href="https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s" target="_blank">elastic4s DSL homepage</a>
				to learn how to express appropriate queries with the Scala DSL.
				Consult 
				<a href="https://github.com/evojam/play-elastic4s" target="_blank">play-elastic4s module page</a> for
				nuances regarding Play-Elasticsearch integration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Good luck with your application!
